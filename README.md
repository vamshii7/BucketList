## To-Do List

This is a very simple flask application that enables end-user to add Items to his/hers To-Do list.
The items are saved locally in `/app-storage/list.txt` file.

Developed to exaplain on example the difference between **stateful** and **stateless app**, and how to save a state in kubernetes.

Docker image is available via: https://hub.docker.com/r/vamshii7/todo
